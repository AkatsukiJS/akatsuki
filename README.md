### About Us

We are an organization, formed by some students of the Course of Science Computer of Universidade Federal do Piauí, located in Teresina-Piauí, Brazil.

JS Enthusiasts, disgusted with the Course and "zueiros". We do some projects just for learning and fun. We only use JavaScript ♥.

Comming soon a free course with Stack NMVR (We already started with the bureaucracy to offer the course)!

And after, a decent site, at our style!
